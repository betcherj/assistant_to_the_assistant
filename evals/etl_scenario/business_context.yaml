# Business Context for ETL Repository
# This describes the business domain and context for an ETL system that uses LLM
# natural language parsing to extract Pydantic models from text

purpose: |
  Build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system that processes unstructured text documents
  and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured data as Pydantic models.
  The system handles domain-specific language in prompts and order processing workflows.
  The extracted models represent business entities like orders, customers, and products
  from natural language text sources such as emails, invoices, and customer communications.

external_constraints:
  - Must process documents in multiple formats (PDF, plain text, markdown)
  - Must handle domain-specific terminology and abbreviations
  - Must support batch processing for high-volume document ingestion
  - Must maintain audit trails for all extracted data
  - Must comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
  - Must support real-time processing for urgent orders
  - Must handle multilingual documents (primary: English, secondary: Spanish, French)

domain_terminology:
  order_model:
    - "PO" refers to Purchase Order
    - "SKU" refers to Stock Keeping Unit
    - "ETA" refers to Estimated Time of Arrival
    - "FOB" refers to Free On Board shipping terms
    - "Net 30" refers to payment terms (30 days)
  
  prompt_model:
    - "Entity extraction" refers to identifying business entities in text
    - "Field mapping" refers to mapping extracted text to Pydantic model fields
    - "Confidence score" refers to LLM's confidence in extraction accuracy
    - "Validation rules" refer to business rules for data quality

business_rules:
  - Orders must have a valid customer reference
  - Order amounts must be positive numbers
  - Product SKUs must match inventory system format
  - Shipping addresses must include country code
  - Order dates cannot be in the future
  - Priority orders (marked "URGENT") must be processed within 5 minutes

data_entities:
  - Order: Contains order details, customer info, line items, shipping info
  - Customer: Contains customer identification and contact information
  - Product: Contains product details, SKU, pricing information
  - ShippingAddress: Contains shipping destination details
  - OrderLineItem: Contains individual product line items within an order
