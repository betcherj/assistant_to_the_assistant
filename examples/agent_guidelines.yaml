# Agent Guidelines Configuration
# This file defines coding standards, best practices, and guardrails for LLM-generated code

guardrails:
  - Never commit API keys, secrets, or credentials to code
  - Always validate and sanitize user input
  - Never execute user-provided code or SQL without proper sanitization
  - Always use parameterized queries for database operations
  - Never expose sensitive information in error messages or logs

best_practices:
  - Use type hints for all function parameters and return types
  - Write docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
  - Follow PEP 8 style guide
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility principle)
  - Write unit tests for all new functionality
  - Use dependency injection for better testability

coding_standards:
  - Use async/await for I/O operations
  - Return Pydantic models from API endpoints
  - Use environment variables for configuration
  - Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions
  - Use logging instead of print statements
  - Follow RESTful API conventions
  - Use database migrations for schema changes
